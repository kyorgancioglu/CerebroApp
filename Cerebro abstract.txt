Cerebro is a mobile app that allows the user to scan the cover of a media (film posters, album and book covers, etc.). The app automatically recognises the media and brings up information about it, collected from third party sources. The information may include reviews, summaries, scores, suggestions and useful links such as purchase links, samples, official websites, etc. Users will be able to view concentrated information collected from all of their favourite sources in one single UI instead of searching all around the web just to collect some information about a media. Since the information is collected from third party sources via automation, the database is easily extensible. The information that is displayed upon scanning is customisable. Users can choose which sources should be displayed when they scan a media. This allows the user to personalise their experience. The initial release of Cerebro will be for Android devices. The image recognition part and other compute intensive parts of processing will be done on a web server which will work together with the mobile device.
